# gameportfolio

This is the `gameportfolio` site — a Three.js-based interactive portfolio built from the provided "Autumn Delivery" template.

Structure:
- `index.html` — entry HTML (loads `css/styles.css` and `js/app.js`).
- `css/styles.css` — extracted styles.
- `js/app.js` — main game/app logic (modularized).

How to run locally (from repository root):

```
npm run start
# then open http://localhost:3000/gameportfolio
```

You can also start with this site as the default shown at `/`:

```
./scripts/start-3000.sh gameportfolio
```
